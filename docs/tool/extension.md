# Extending QuRA

All the logic for the analysis of a specific resource metric is encoded as a *metric module*, that is, an instance of `GlobalMetricModule` (for global metrics) or `LocalMetricModule` (for local metrics).
This guide is meant to aid contributors in the implementation of new metric modules, that is, in the extension of QuRA with the analysis of new kinds of resources.

## The `Index` datatype

The definition of a new metric analysis boils down to specifying *what resource annotations should be produced* when analyzing a small number of key circuit building scenarios. These annotations are called *indices*, and they are essentially arithmetic expressions built from natural numbers and index variables. They are represented as the `Index` datatype, in the [`Index.AST`](../AST.hs) module. 

Here is a list of the `Index` constructors that can be used when defining new metrics:

- `Number :: Int -> Index` makes an index out of an integer number. For matters of soundness, this number should be non-negative.
- `IVar :: IVarId -> Index` makes an index variable out of a string identifier.
- `Plus :: Index -> Index -> Index` represents the sum of two index expressions.
- `Minus :: Index -> Index -> Index` represents the natural subtractions of two index expression. Note that `Minus e1 e2` is equal to zero whenever `e1` is less or equal than `e2`.
- `Mult :: Index -> Index -> Index` represents the product of two index expressions
- `Max :: Index -> Index -> Index` represents the maximum of two index expressions
- `BoundedSum :: IVarId -> Index -> Index` represents the bounded sum of indices. `BoundedSum "i" e1 e2` is the sum for `i` going from 0 (included) to `e1` (excluded) of `e2`, where `e2` can depend on `i`.
- `BoundedMax :: IVarId -> Index -> Index` represents the bounded maximum of indices. `BoundedMax "i" e1 e2` is the maximum for `i` going from 0 (included) to `e1` (excluded) of `e2`, where `e2` can depend on `i`.

## Global metrics

### Defining a global metric module

An instance of `GlobalMetricModule` requires the definition of the following functions:

- `name :: String` is just the name of the metric, used for pretty printing.
- `desugarIdentity :: Index` defines the neutral element for the metric (e.g. what it means to have "no width"). This is usually just `Number 0`.
- `desugarWire :: WireType -> Index` defines the size of a wire, which might depend on its wiretype. Note that `WireType = Bit | Qubit`. For example, for width:
  ```
  -- src/Index/Semantics/Global/Width.hs

  desugarWire Bit = Number 1
  desugarWire Qubit = Number 1
  ```

- `desugarOperation :: QuantumOperation -> Index` defines the size of each elementary quantum operation available in PQR. The list of of available `QuantumOperation`s is available in the [`Circuit`](../../Circuit.hs) module. For example, for T-count:
  ```
  -- src/Index/Semantics/Global/TCount.hs

  desugarOperation T = Number 1
  desugarOperation _ = Number 0
  ```
- `desugarSequence :: Index -> Index -> Index` defines the size of two circuits composed in sequence. Suppose `C` is a circuit of size `e1` and `D` is a circuit of size `e2`. Then, `desugarSequence e1 e2` should be the size of the composition in sequence of `C` and `D`. For example, for width:
  ```
  -- src/Index/Semantics/Global/Width.hs

  desugarSequence e1 e2 = Max e1 e2
  ```
- `desugarParallel :: Index -> Index -> Index` defines the size of two circuits composed in parallel. Suppose `C` is a circuit of size `e1` and `D` is a circuit of size `e2`. Then, `desugarSequence  e1 e2` should be the size of the composition in parallel of `C` and `D`. For example, for width:
    ```
  -- src/Index/Semantics/Global/Width.hs
  
  desugarParallel e1 e2 = Plus e1 e2
    ```
- `desugarBoundedSequence :: IVarId -> Index -> Index -> Index` is the same as `desugarSequence`, but generalized to bounded sequences. That is, `desugarBoundedSequence "i" e1 e2` is the size of the circuit obtained by composing in sequence `e1` circuits, where the size of the `i`-th circuit is `e2` and might depend on `i`.
  ```
  -- src/Index/Semantics/Global/Width.hs
  
  desugarBoundedSequence i e1 e2 = BoundedMax i e1 e2
    ```
- `desugarBoundedParallel :: IVarId -> Index -> Index -> Index` is the same as `desugarParallel`, but generalized to bounded sequences. That is, `desugarBoundedParallel "i" e1 e2` is the size of the circuit obtained by composing in parallel `e1` circuits, where the size of the `i`-th circuit is `e2` and might depend on `i`.
  ```
  -- src/Index/Semantics/Global/Width.hs
  
  desugarBoundedParallel i e1 e2 = BoundedSum i e1 e2
    ```

### Making it available through QuRA's interface

Once you have defined a global resource module, you need to make the following changes [`Main.hs`](../../../app/Main.hs) in order to make it available from QuRA's interface:

1. Add a new case to `globalMetricArgParser` to parse your new metric as a command line option.
2. Also add your metric's name to the error message of the argument parser, so that users know it's there.

If your metric is defined in `myGlobalMetricModule` and is called `myglobalmetric`, the last lines of the case analysis in `globalMetricArgParser` should look like this:

```
globalMetricArgParser = do
  s <- str 
  case s of
  ...
  "myglobalmetric" -> return myGlobalMetricModule
  _ -> readerError "Supported global resources are 'width', 'gatecount', 'qubits', 'bits', 'tcount', `myglobalmetric`"

```

Finally, to analyze `myglobalmetric` with QuRA, run
```
qura FILE -g myglobalmetric
```

## Local metrics

### Defining a local metric module

An instance of `LocalMetricModule` requires the definition of the following functions:

- `name :: String` is just the name of the metric, used for pretty printing.
- `desugarOutput :: QuantumOperation -> Int -> [Index] -> Index` describes the local metric associated to each of the outputs of a quantum operations, as a function of the operation and its inputs. `desugarOutput op n inMetrics` is the local metric associated to the `n`-th output of `op`, when the local metrics associated to its inputs are those in `inMetrics`. For example, for depth:

  ```
  -- src/Index/Semantics/Local/Depth.hs

  desugarOutput _ _ inDepths = foldr Max (Number 0)
                                $ map (Number 1 `Plus`) inDepths
  ```

For more examples of local metric modules, consult the modules under [`Index.Semantics.Local`](Local)

### Making it available through QuRA's interface

Once you have defined a local resource module, you need to make the following changes [`Main.hs`](../../../app/Main.hs) in order to make it available from QuRA's interface:

1. Add a new case to `localMetricArgParser` to parse your new metric as a command line option.
2. Also add your metric's name to the error message of the argument parser, so that users know it's there.

If your metric is defined in `myLocalMetricModule` and is called `mylocalmetric`, the last lines of the case analysis in `localMetricArgParser` should look like this:

```
localMetricArgParser = do
  s <- str 
  case s of
  ...
  "mylocalmetric" -> return myLocalMetricModule
  _ -> readerError "Supported local resources are 'depth', `tdepth`, `mylocalmetric`"

```

Finally, to analyze `mylocalmetric` with QuRA, run
```
qura FILE -l mylocalmetric
```
